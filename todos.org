#+title: TODOS

* DONE The Web Conference Rebuttal
- Meet with Ramya to discuss the draft
- Do simulation with different number of classes, tables
        - Same something more, think about how clases interfere with the bias
- Mention that existing noise models are not accurate (why the compelling evidence itself is important)
- We do belive that the pattern be broadly applicable, highlight the nuances in the dogs3 and birds5 dataset
- Crowdsourcing is in the call of the paper, well within the scope of the track and the Web
- How we model the noises curucally depends on hwo we understand the contextual bias. It's all noise.
- Contextual:
        - hierchical relationship of the items, and give example
- Future work:
        - Consider ranking (ordered list)
        - How to design new noise model
                - incorporating the hierchical into the model
- Existing work does not take these into acccount (contextual bias, hierchiy)

- Looks like miss understanding, we have varying p, and the p is from SBM, which is the case where m = 2. What do you mean by the question, could you explain in more detail?
- Please clarify: However, I assume the purpose of such models is for ground truth recovery

* OKAY AISTATS Rebuttal
- Meet with Gokcan to discuss the runtime performance experiment
* TODO PabLO Faster Gradient Descent
- ResNet18 + CIFAR10
- Batched version
- Implement using old loss
- Implement using the new loss (with ReLU)
